##  Who are you, and what do you do?

JM Ibanez, jack of all trades-slash-software architect at

## What hardware do you use?

My current machine is a mid-2009 13" MacBook Pro that I bought and
steadily upgraded over the years, first by bumping RAM from 2 GB (!!)
to 4 GB, then maxing out at 8 GB. I then purchased an SSD in March of
last year, as well as a data doubler, allowing me to keep my Mac's
(slow) hard drive for added storage. Finally, I purchased a 500 GB,
7200 RPM hard drive to replace the one that I put in the data
doubler. I also have a bunch of external hard disks, and a Firewire
800-based 1 TB drive I use as a Time Machine backup/archive disk.

I prefer to use my [Sennheiser PX-100-II i](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX-100-II-Supra-Aural-Headset/dp/B003WV8PKG) headset when listening to music.

I also have an iPhone 4S as both a dev device and my actual phone; I
had an iPhone 4 before that.

Gaming-wise, I only have a Nintendo DS Lite, and somewhere in my
closet I have a working Nintendo Gameboy.

## And what software?

* Emacs for editing (among other things...)
* Git for version control
* Safari for browsing; occasionally Chrome for testing
* DevonThink Pro for bookmarks and notes
* Spideroak for backups and secure storage
* Dropbox for sharing
* Sparrow for mail (hosted on GMail)
* Rackspace cloud servers
* Hover
* Steam for gaming

## What would be your dream setup?

Haven't thought of a "dream setup", to be honest, but I do lust after:

* Mac Pro (the new one, and the old one)
* Multiple 30" displays (I have a single 23" I use, though)
* For portability: a 13" MacBook Air, and/or a 15" rMBP.

I'd also like to get my hands on a bunch of old hardware. On my short
list:

* A NeXT Cube
* An original Apple Newton
* A working first-generation PC
* Any old SGI workstation (circa Jurassic Park), maybe an Indigo
* A Cobalt server

And the list goes on...
