##  Who are you, and what do you do?

## What hardware do you use?

I've retired my mid-2009 13" MacBook Pro that I bought and steadily
upgraded over the years; I've upgraded my personal machine to a
mid-2019 13" MacBook Pro with 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports and 16GB of
RAM. Admittedly, I could have gone for the 16" MacBook Pro (as it came
out a few days _after_ I purchased my laptop), but I really like the
portability of the 13".

I also have an older 13" MacBook Pro that work has issued to me. I've
opted to use my refurbished Das Keyboard at my desk at work. I spend
most of my day writing code on it, which is nice. I really haven't
decided on an alternate keyboard for home.

For backups and storage, I've acquired a [Synology NAS, a
DS918+](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B075DDZ894/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I
use it mostly as a Time Machine backup device over the network. I've
also dumped my ripped media on it so I can stream them to my home TV.

I also acquired two Raspberry PIs a few years back, both of them
original Model As, one with a case and one without (bare board). I
still haven't yet decided what to do with them yet.

My choice of headsets has changed. Previously, I opted for a
[Sennheiser PX-100-II
i](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX-100-II-Supra-Aural-Headset/dp/B003WV8PKG)
headset, but switched to using an AudioTechnica ATH-M50 at my desk,
since the PX-100-IIs can be pretty noisy, being open-backed. I commute
with a pair of [Sennheiser CX 300s in-ear
headphones](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/earbuds-in-ear-headphones-cx-300-s)

(The ATH-M50 is no longer sold, but the [ATH-M50X is more-or-less the
same, with a replaceable
cable](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1526327239&sr=8-3&keywords=audiotechnica+ath-m50))

My everyday phone is an iPhone XS, which replaced my iPhone 6; I
previously had an iPhone 4S and an iPhone 4 before that. My Blackberry
Playbook is dead, sadly: the LCD was cracked and I tried replacing it,
but the replacement LCD was also damaged during shipping -- sad
times.

I have a Nintendo Switch I play on for a lot of my mobile gaming, and
I stopped playing on my Nintendo DS Lite (I just need to find a
replacement adapter/charger).


## And what software?

* Emacs for editing (among other things...)
* Git for version control
* Safari for browsing; occasionally Chrome or Firefox when some
  internal site needs it
* DEVONthink Pro for bookmarks and notes on my personal machine
* Backblaze for backups
* Dropbox for sharing
* Work email is via Outlook (I've learned to live with it)
* Hover
* Steam for gaming

## What would be your dream setup?

Haven't thought of a "dream setup", to be honest, but I do lust after:

* the iMac Pro
* Multiple 30" displays (I have dual 27" monitors I use at work, though)

I'd also like to get my hands on a bunch of old hardware. On my short
list:

* A NeXT Cube
* An original Apple Newton
* A working first-generation PC
* Any old SGI workstation (circa Jurassic Park), maybe an Indigo
* A Cobalt server

And the list goes on...
