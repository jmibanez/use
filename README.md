# JM Ibanez

##  Who are you, and what do you do?

JM Ibanez, jack of all trades, formerly software architect at
[CodeFlux](http://www.teamcodeflux.com/).

## What hardware do you use?

My current personal machine is *still* a mid-2009 13" MacBook Pro that
I bought and steadily upgraded over the years, first by bumping RAM
from 2 GB (!!)  to 4 GB, then maxing out at 8 GB. I then purchased an
SSD in March of 2012, as well as a data doubler, allowing me to keep
my Mac's (slow) hard drive for added storage. I initially purchased a
500 GB, 7200 RPM hard drive to replace the hard drive that I put in
the data doubler, which I then swapped for a 1TB one a few years back,
sometime in 2015 or 2016. I also have a bunch of external hard disks;
I used to have a Firewire 800-based 1 TB drive I use as a Time Machine
backup/archive disk that died, which I've replaced with a USB
3-capable drive, for some upgradability down the line.

I also acquired two Raspberry PIs a few years back, both of them
original Model As, one with a case and one without (bare board). I
haven't yet decided what to do with them yet&mdash; one of them used
to be a print server at the office.

I also use a refurbished Das Keyboard when I can at home.

My choice of headsets has changed. Previously, I opted for a
[Sennheiser PX-100-II
i](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX-100-II-Supra-Aural-Headset/dp/B003WV8PKG)
headset, but switched to using an AudioTechnica ATH-M50 (no longer
sold, but the [ATH-M50X is more-or-less the same, with a replaceable
cable](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1526327239&sr=8-3&keywords=audiotechnica+ath-m50)
at my desk, since the PX-100-IIs can be pretty noisy, being
open-backed. I commute with a pair of [Advanced M4 in-ear
monitors](https://www.amazon.com/M4-Headphones-Controller-Tangle-Free-Sound/dp/B071JRHDL7)

My everyday phone is an iPhone 6, which replaced my iPhone 4S; I had
an iPhone 4 before that. My Blackberry Playbook is sort-of dead (the
LCD is cracked).

I still play on my Nintendo DS Lite, but I plan to get a Switch
sometime before Christmas this year.

## And what software?

* Emacs for editing (among other things...)
* Git for version control
* Safari for browsing; occasionally Chrome or Firefox for testing
* DEVONthink Pro for bookmarks and notes
* Backblaze for backups
* Dropbox for sharing
* Mail.app for email
* Rackspace cloud servers
* Hover
* Steam for gaming

## What would be your dream setup?

Haven't thought of a "dream setup", to be honest, but I do lust after:

* the iMac Pro
* Multiple 30" displays (I have a single 23" I use, though)
* For portability: the new 12" MacBook, and/or a 15" MBP.

I'd also like to get my hands on a bunch of old hardware. On my short
list:

* A NeXT Cube
* An original Apple Newton
* A working first-generation PC
* Any old SGI workstation (circa Jurassic Park), maybe an Indigo
* A Cobalt server

And the list goes on...
